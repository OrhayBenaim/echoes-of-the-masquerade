### Game Idea: "Echoes of the Masquerade"

**Setting**: A mysterious masquerade ball where all players take on secret roles, blending hidden identities and social deduction. The goal is for players to reveal or eliminate others based on clues, teamwork, and deception, while avoiding being exposed themselves.

### Core Gameplay:

1. **Roles and Objectives**:

   - Players are assigned different roles (e.g., Spy, Guest, Assassin, Watcher) at the beginning of the game. Each role has its own secret objectives:
     - **Spy**: Uncover the identities of other players.
     - **Guest**: Survive the night without being eliminated.
     - **Assassin**: Eliminate a specific target.
     - **Watcher**: Prevent eliminations and gather evidence.
   - Every round, players interact and make decisions based on their roles. No one knows anyone else's role.

2. **Communication Mechanic**:

   - Players use their phones to communicate. Each player has a limited number of "private chats" per round, which they can use to secretly message others for alliances, trades, or threats.
   - Players are allowed to make speeches out loud but can lie, accuse, or mislead.

3. **Timed Rounds and Voting**:
   - Each round lasts 3–5 minutes. During this time, players:
     1. **Gather Clues**: Each player receives vague clues about others' identities based on their proximity in the room or actions.
     2. **Discuss and Accuse**: Players can openly accuse others, starting group debates.
     3. **Vote**: At the end of the round, players vote on someone they believe should be unmasked or eliminated.
   - The player with the most votes reveals their role and either survives or is eliminated based on their actions.

### Unique Twist: **Echoes Mechanic**

- At the start of each round, all players hear a mysterious "echo" on their phones—randomized cryptic messages or events. These echoes might hint at someone’s role, an event happening in the room, or a past action.
- **Echoes** could also give false information, introducing a layer of paranoia and misdirection.

### Core Game Loop:

1. **Assign Roles**: At the start of each match, players secretly receive their roles, goals, and starting clues.
2. **Rounds Begin**:
   - Players interact, gather information, send private messages, and form alliances.
   - Echoes start to appear, creating confusion or insight. Players must analyze them to determine which are real.
3. **Vote and Eliminate**: At the end of the round, players vote on someone to be unmasked. If a player’s role is revealed, it drastically changes the dynamic, giving new clues to everyone else.
4. **Winning Conditions**: Each role has specific objectives:
   - **Spies** win by unmasking all but one person.
   - **Guests** win by surviving until the end.
   - **Assassins** win by eliminating their targets.
   - **Watchers** win by exposing the Assassin or Spy.

### Replayability:

- **Random Roles**: With every game, roles are reshuffled, and objectives change.
- **Echo Variations**: The cryptic messages and events during the game are dynamically generated, leading to different experiences each time.
- **Multiple Game Modes**: Introduce modes like "Double Agents," where players can have dual roles, or "Time Pressure," where rounds are shortened, forcing quick decisions.
